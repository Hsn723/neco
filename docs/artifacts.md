Artifacts
=========

Artifacts `artifacts.go` is a collection of components which are tested by [dctest](../dctest/).
It is given as a go file with structs, and is compiled into neco binaries.
See [types.go](../types.go) for details of structs.

**This file is generated by `generate-artifacts` command. PLEASE DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY**

There are two artifacts files.

- [artifacts.go](../artifacts.go)

    This file is for developers to define the set of artifacts to be tested.
    Developers may update this file anytime by using `generate-artifacts`
    or by editing manually.

- [artifacts_release.go](../artifacts.go)

    This file is for CI.  The CI job updates this file by using
    `generate-artifacts --release`.

    The developers are PROHIBITED to modify this file.  This is to prevent
    merge conflicts in CI flow.

    This file exists only in the `release` branch.

When generating neco binaries and the neco deb package, `artifacts.go` is used
in default.  A CI job uses `artifacts_release.go` by specifying `TAGS=release`
for `make` command after checking-out the `release` branch.
