Artifacts
=========

Artifacts `artifacts.go` is a collection of components which are tested by [dctest](../dctest/).
It is given as a go file with structs to be included in neco binaries.
See [types.go](../types.go) for details of structs.

**This file is generated by `generate-artifacts` command. PLEASE DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY** 

There are two artifacts files.

- [artifacts.go](../artifacts.go)

    For developers.  They can update this file anytime using `generate-artifacts`.

- [artifacts_release.go](../artifacts.go)

    For CI.  The job updates this file using `generate-artifacts --release`.  
    The developers are PROHIBITED to modify this in order to prevent merge conficts in CI flow.

    This is managed only in the release branch.

When generating neco binaries and the neco deb package, `artifacts.go` is used
in default.  You can specify `TAGS=release` for make command to use `artifacts_release.go`.
